## üìö Overview

AI Tutor is an educational application that leverages advanced AI to provide personalized tutoring in chemistry, mathematics, and physics. The application uses a specialized agent system to route questions to the appropriate subject expert, ensuring accurate and helpful responses for students.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Subject-Specific AI Tutoring**: Specialized agents for chemistry, mathematics, and physics
- **Intelligent Query Routing**: Automatically directs questions to the appropriate subject expert
- **Beautiful Chat Interface**: Modern, responsive UI with real-time typing indicators
- **Markdown Support**: Renders formatted text, code blocks, and mathematical expressions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error management with user-friendly messages

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project is divided into two main components:

### Backend (`AiTutor_backend`)

- Built with FastAPI and Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Implements a root agent that routes queries to specialized subject agents
- Provides a RESTful API endpoint for the frontend to communicate with

### Frontend (`AiTutor_frontend`)

- Built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript
- Features a modern, responsive UI with animations and a chat interface
- Communicates with the backend API to process user queries
- Renders AI responses with proper formatting for educational content

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Python (v3.9 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- pip

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd AiTutor_backend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The server will start on http://localhost:8000

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd AiTutor_frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
   The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## üîß API Endpoints

- `GET /health`: Check if the API is running
- `POST /ask`: Send a question to the AI tutor
  - Request body: `{ "question": "Your question here" }`
  - Response: `{ "response": "AI response" }`

## üß† AI Agents

The system uses three specialized agents:

1. **Chemistry Agent**: Handles questions about chemical elements, reactions, compounds, and the periodic table
2. **Mathematics Agent**: Solves problems related to algebra, calculus, geometry, and other math topics
3. **Physics Agent**: Answers questions about mechanics, electricity, thermodynamics, and other physics concepts

The root agent intelligently routes queries to the appropriate specialized agent based on the question's content.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)
- Gemini 2.0 Flash model

### Frontend
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Lucide React (for icons)
